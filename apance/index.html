  <p>I spent three months doing an internship at Apance, where I got to build various features in SwiftUI for their creative iPad app, which is in early access.</p>

		<p>Layer Editing</p>
		<img src="/images/apance-01.png" />
		<figcaption>This was the most complicated feature to implement. It took a lot of problem solving skills to visualize how a layer could be moved, rotated, and scaled on the screen while also allowing the user to move, rotate, and zoom in/out of the canvas. Especially difficult was getting the correct position when rotating, since you can rotate about any point. I had to convert different trigonometric equations to code functions so the angle and scale could offset the position of the layer on the canvas and the screen.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure id="port_2" class="port-content">
		<p>Import / Export</p>
		<img src="/images/apance-02.png" />
		<figcaption>I implemented a menu to be able to export a PNG or JPG of the project or import a photo from the user’s camera roll or the Files app (including iCloud Drive) to add as a layer to the project. This required converting a UIKit share sheet into a SwiftUI view and sending it an image of the canvas generated from the Metal engine.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure id="port_3" class="port-content">
		<p>Comments</p>
		<img src="/images/apance-03.png" />
		<figcaption>The last feature I worked on was a commenting interface. The user can drag to highlight an area of focus, then type to enter a comment. Other users can see this as a bubble on the canvas while comments are toggled. Getting these bubbles to remain in the correct position even as the canvas is moved around, rotated and zoomed in/out was a challenge. I solved it by using a stored location of the comment relative to the canvas, then reusing some of the code for the Layer Editing feature to convert the canvas location/scale/rotation to the correct position of the comment bubble. I also used SwiftUI’s animation functionality to make adding these comments fluid.</figcaption>
