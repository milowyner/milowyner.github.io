  <h1>Hi. I’m Milo, an iOS developer.</h1>
<p>I’ve been developing iOS apps for the past six years. I’m passionate about software, and I have a great attention to detail. Take a look at some of the projects I’ve worked on.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Royal Caribbean International <em>iOS App</em></dt>
	<dd>While working at Branding Brand, I had the pleasure of working on the Royal Caribbean International app. I implemented many features and fixed known bugs. One big feature was a component on their main screen, where I used SwiftUl to create a dynamic grid of images with text overlays that were customizable from their backend system. I also tweaked parts of their booking flow and helped connect the For You feed to their content system.</dd>
	<dd class="align-center"><img src="/images/work-royal-caribbean.png" alt="Three screenshots from iPhone app. The first view shows a row of restaurant images followed by an onboard credit application block. The second view shows a visual grid of cruise types as call-to-actions with a headline that reads “your dream vacation starts here.” The third view shows a cruise cost summary followed by a form to collect guest info." /></dd>

	<dt>Burberry <em>iOS App</em></dt>
	<dd>I spent a large part of my time at Branding Brand as the sole iOS developer for the Burberry app. I led a brand refresh, a network-request migration, and added Apple Pay integration. The branding tasks included text, color, and logo updates, as well as a button/UI overhaul. The network-request migration to GraphQL included creating a custom code-generation SDK. For Apple Pay, I wrote a script to simplify the process of adding translated text. And throughout the app I fixed bugs and improved the UI.</dd>
	<dd class="align-center"><img src="/images/work-burberry.png" alt="Promotional image for the iPhone app. It includes a photo of an iPhone that displays the main view. It’s a list of category links, the company name, and core navigation components overlaying a full-screen photo of an ornamental bridge at night. There’s also a photo of a second iPhone that displays a large feature image of a young woman sitting on a wall by the river with an urban landscape behind her and a title that reads “selected for you,” followed by a grid of products. On the side of the iPhones is a large photo of a young man sitting at an outdoor restaurant table, staring off into the distance." /></dd>

	<dt>Apance <em>iPad App</em></dt>
	<dd>I spent three months doing an internship at Apance, where I got to build various features in SwiftUI for their creative iPad app, which is in early access.</dd>
	<dd class="align-center"><img src="/images/work-apance.png" alt="Image of an iPad showing a view from the iOS app. The main area of the view displays some sketching over a canvas that’s being rotated, denoted by a selection marquee. There’s also a sidebar with navigation, editing tools, and a share widget." /></dd>

	<dt>Will Robots Take Over Today? <em>iPhone App</em></dt>
	<dd>I built a simple weather app that also tells you if robots will take over the world today based on the conditions like rain, sun, etc. It involved requesting data from a weather API, handling possible errors, and adding smooth animations between different views. I used UIKit storyboards for this app.</dd>
	<dd class="align-center"><img src="/images/work-robots.png" alt="Three screenshots from the iPhone app. The first view shows a full-screen illustration of falling rain on a gray background with weather data overlaid. The data includes the word “rain,” temperature, “feels like,” wind speed, and nearest storm. The bottom of the view includes a robot icon with a call-to-action that includes an arrow and the words “will robots take over the world today?” The second view shows a robot illustration with an evil facial expression over a red background. There’s a caption that reads “yes. With the sun shining brightly, it’s a perfect day for an annhilation of the human race.” The top of the view shows the original call-to-action in reverse. The third view shows an illustration of some hills over a blue background with weather data overlaid." /></dd>
